# LedButton-Game
the best game in the world 


Sence of the game lies in the fact that you have time to press button that corresponds to the led.
You have random time to press the correct button.
Also you can choose how much time ( 10/20/30 sec ) you want to play game.
If you pressed the correct button, you gain +1 point to your score, if not you gain +0 points, or if button wasnt pressed you gain +0 points too.
And if button was pressed, you will skip time that player have to press button and go to next round.
When game ends, player will return to the start to play again.


Its my first project so please dont blame me
Good luck and have fun ;)
